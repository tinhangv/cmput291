We have users u1, u2, and john doe, where
u1 follows u2, and       f1: (flwer = u1, flwee =u2)
john doe follows u2      f2: (flwer = 'john doe', flwee =u2)

since there are two following relationships, we need to put the follows relation twice in the FROM clause
user is also listed on the FROM clause so we can get the id of u2

To get the time of the tweet from now, I use the julianday function, which converts a date to a decimal value. 
This allows the comparison of two dates by finding the difference in their julianday values.

In the where clause I restrict the rows to match the 4 conditions:
    u1 followed by u2 for at least 90 days
    the flwee in f1 and f2 are both u2 -> so u1 and john doe both follow u2
    john doe is the flwer in f2
    user 2 followed by john doe for less than 90 days

the desired users are users u1 satisfying the conditions, whos id can be obtained using the users relation
