Details:

I split the query into:
    The set of users who have at least three different tweets that mention Edmonton in tweet text 
    minus
    the set of users who have followers

set 1 except set 2

For the first set:
Without using aggregation, grouping, and nesting, we cannot simply use the count function to get the count of tweets, grouped by users

The workaround is specify the tweets relation 3 times in the FROM clause
In the where clause we restrict the rows so that:
    the writer in all 3 tweet tables are the same user, and
    all 3 tweets mention edmonton (includes the substring 'edmonton'), but
    the 3 tweets are different (they have different texts)

For the second set:
simply select all flwees from follows, since the follows table records all following relationships
