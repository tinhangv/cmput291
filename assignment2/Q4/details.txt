This is equivalent to the intersection of the sets of:
    1, users who have no tweets, and 
    2, users who follow every user followed by John Doe

1, this is the same as finding users who are not in the set of {users who have tweets}

2, This is a statement of the form
    "Find the subset of items in one set that are related to all items in another set"

    This can be done using division. I used the approach given in the slides.
    output u1 if B-A is empty (B is a subset of A), where 
    B = all users followed by JD
    A = all users followed by a particular user u1
