I find the set of list with more three tweets and intersect it with the set of lists where 50% of tweets have been retweeted

To find lists with more than 3 tweets, group the includes table by list names, and count the number of rows in each group, and exclude each group that has less than or equal to 3 rows

To find the set of lists where at least 50% of tweets have been retweeted, 
    we need to find lists where the number of retweeted tweets / number of tweets > 0.5
    This can be done by left joining the includes and retweets table based on tweets
    so that if a tweet doesn't have a retweet, the retweet attributes will be null
    group the rows by list names so that we can perform aggregation on each seperate list
    we take advantage of the fact that count(*) counts all rows, even ones with null values, but count(attribute) only counts non null rows
    each tweet is only retweeted if the atttibutes in the retweets columns are not null
    therefore the expression count(r.retweeter)/count(*) gives the ratio needed to apply the restriction of 50% retweet rate
