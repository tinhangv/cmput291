Details:

Since the number of tweets in each month is not related to the number of retweets in each month, 
I used common table expressions to define two seperate result sets
The month and year of a date can be found using the strftime function 
Using the year I can restrict the rows to those with dates in 2024

in the common table expression:
for the first set (u)
    I get the month, number of null replies, and number of replies in each month
    using the tweets table
    since the aggregates are calculated for each month, I group by month
    replies are tweets with non-null reply fields
    to get the number of replies, use count on one of the reply fields. This counts the rows with non-null fields
    to get the null fields, use count(*) to get the total number of rows and subtract that by the number of replies

for the second set (v)
    I get the total number of retweets made in each month

In the main query
    I need to left join u and v using the month, since all months in u need to be in the result
    Some entries in v may be null, if retweets are not made in that month, in which case we should return 0 instead
        for the retweets in that month. To convert to 0 if null, use the coalesce function
    
    finally return the counts grouped by month
