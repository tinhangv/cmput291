I split this into the union of 2 sets
    In the first set I find the users with the most followers
    In the second set I find the top user in average retweet times

To do that I defined two sets in a common table expression:
    RankedUserFlwers: 
        I used the approach in question 6 to rank the users based on number of followers
    AveRetCnt:
        I first get a set with the number of times each tweet has been retweeted, and the user who made the tweet
        I then group this set by the writer and select the average number of times a tweet made by that user is retweeted

To select the top user(s) in followers I select the users ranked 1 in RankedUserFlwers
To select the top user in average retweet times I get the rows in AveRetCnt with maximum average retweets

I return the union of these two sets
