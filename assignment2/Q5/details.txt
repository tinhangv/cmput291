I first drew a diagram showing the relation between the user, the tweet, the users who retweeted the tweet, and the retweeters who follow the user

                retweet
user ->  tweet  --> user  --
|                -->        | 
|                ...        |-> count >3
|                -->       _|
|________________________|
        follows                    

The relations in the diagram are tweets, retweets, follows


Every user who has a tweet is in the writer column of tweets

the writer of the original tweet is a follower of the retweeter (follows relationship), and 
the original tweet in the tweet relation is equal to the retweeted tweet in the retweet relation

I group the tuples by the specific tweet, so that the number of distinct followers for each tweet can be found

finally, only output the tweets that are retweeted by more than 3 followers (having clause applies condition to each tweet seperately)
