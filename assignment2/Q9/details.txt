Used chatgpt to figure out how to join multiple tables.

My idea was to use 3 different sets:
    one for getting the number of replies to each tweet
    one for getting the number of times the tweet is retweeted
    one for getting the number of tweets mentioning the same hashtag

Since all three sets may have missing rows and not include all tweets, I also make a set of all tweets

I then left join the 3 sets onto the set of all tweets, so that I get one single set with the counts for
    number of replies, number of times retweeted, and number of tweets mentioning the same hashtag

Since some of the counts may be null on the resulting set, I use the coalesce function to turn null values to 0
